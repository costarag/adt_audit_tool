## ADT - Audit Tool	

ADT is a web based system created to grab data from MyAIESEC.net and organize it focusing on audit of exchange documents (Contracts, Acceptance Notes and more). System also allow audit Legal and Terms documents.

### Technologies

Mostly coded in PHP and jQuery that connects to MySQL DB.

### How it works

ADT grabs data from My@ emulating user clicks and navigation. That said, system is sensible to any change on the AIESEC system, when it happens, a code review is necessary on the parser side.
