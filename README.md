## ADT - Audit Tool	

ADT is a web system created to track status of relevant audit documents. The system grabs data from MyAIESEC.net, stores in a database and enable users visualize and/or edit status of exchange and legal documents. Splitted by areas.

### Technologies

Mostly coded in PHP and jQuery that connects to MySQL DB.

### How it works

ADT grabs data from My@ emulating user clicks and navigation. That said, system is sensible to any change on the AIESEC system, when it happens, a code review is necessary on the parser side.
