## ADT - Audit Tool	

ADT is a system designed and implemented by me to track status of audit documents. The system grabs data from MyAIESEC.net, parses, converts and stores in a database and enable users visualize and edit status of exchange and legal documents. Divided by areas.

### Technologies

Mostly coded in PHP (grab, parse, covert), jQuery and using a MySQL DB.

### How it works

ADT grabs data from My@ emulating user clicks and navigation. That said, system is sensible to any change on the AIESEC system, when it happens, a code review is necessary on the parser side.
